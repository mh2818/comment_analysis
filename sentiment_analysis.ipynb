The sizzling mexicana comes with a cheese patty is the most right combination that makes you doubt you're own marriage. However, if you don't mind something sweet, the barbecue sizzler with paneer can add sweetness to your life with every bite. I'd suggest you to split this with a pal.\\\\nThe calfornian pizza is one of the best pizza's I've had honestly. It's rich in flavor and brings happiness to your heart. I wouldn't recommend the cheesecake, that is something they have to improve on.\\\\nIt's Affordable and for 3 sizzlers, one pizza, 2 zomato gold the bill came upto just 600.

This was the recommended dish by the staff, hence we were bit disappointed.\\\\nThe only dish which was satisfying was the mix grill which had lamb, chicken, egg & fish.\\\\n\\\\nLastly they do put an extra service charge on top of GST.

The sizzling mexicana comes with a cheese patty is the most right combination that makes you doubt you're own marriage. However, if you don't mind something sweet, the barbecue sizzler with paneer can add sweetness to your life with every bite. I'd suggest you to split this with a pal.\\\\nThe calfornian pizza is one of the best pizza's I've had honestly. It's rich in flavor and brings happiness to your heart. I wouldn't recommend the cheesecake, that is something they have to improve on.\\\\nIt's Affordable and for 3 sizzlers, one pizza, 2 zomato gold the bill came upto just 600.

and ambiance was good the music was too low for a Saturday night Apart from the music the waiter tried to fool us at the time of billing by applying the Zomato Gold on  drink instead of  Probably he thought we were too drunk and dumb to realise but we came out clean Service was too slow and the management was poor  Went on Friday evening with my teamhad a wonderful time  enjoyed a lotGood food as

The food is decent but not wow They had only  beer on tap which was a let down after traveling all the way from indiranagar The music that was playing in the background was awful The staff are

menGolconda chicken was also nicenThis was the first place where Vegetarian food was taken as good Non vegetariannLoved the Thai Chilli and Stuffed Mushroom ballsnLasagne was very rich and creamy stuffed with goodnessnThe deserts at this place were just lip smacking  Should definitely try their Shahi tukda  I would love to go again Or Ill better say I am waiting to go again We went for team party And the food and drinks they serve were greatnWe ordered and tasted many variety of mocktails and they were all great My colleagues tried beer and they all seem to be happy with their beersnWe tasted too many starters and they were great too I am surely coming againxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxfxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxfxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxb  Went to this place on a Thursday evening and had lot of expectations on the craft beer but was disappointednnAlthough the cocktails were great and the food was excellent We ordered prawns and lamb chops and pizza  all three items were good The service is okay  The ambience is bit on the darker side but overall I rate it  coz if the great food and cocktails  Well closer from workthis was on the list from a long timeits got a very Dungy and darkish ambienceI kinda like that ordered mutton sheekh and hefeweizen Both were fab mutton was soft and well tandooredthe beer was fruity and mildthis a nice go to place  I hope they could have given the table a little in advance  Good place and great service The ambience is wonderful Golconda chicken is a definite try The pool table helps socialise well Would definitely visit again in leisure

visit again list xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxfxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx  A good place to go Nice ambience but it could become very noisy when crowded The food is okay for the kind of place My main focus was to try their beer but honestly I was not impressed Im comparing it to what I find in Windmills And that was the only bummer because I had high expectations after I saw a  rating  Its a very cozy place for friends to have chilled beer and some good snacks with sports screening on with a great ambience and zomato gold applicable on drinksits not heavy on your pocket as wellBeing a peaceful place with no over crowding on Friday night and with amazing and quick service they offer I tried their Cheese and jalapeno croquettes that were quite goodbut I was slightly disappointed with paneer Tikka they offered as it was bit burnt so we need to replace it and very courteously they replaced itChakori Murgh Tikka is worth trying for as my friends saidIn mocktails we tried BB exotica which was much sweeter than expected and we tried mojito as well which lived uptoits expectations  Ambiance is really nice This place is nice for beer lovers We went as group of  members and opted for buffet That was a disaster Buffet spread was not at all good Just  options for veg and nonveg each They serve a complimentary drink which we opted to take their sample beer Honestly I think if they want to show off their brewery standard they should serve a decent variety of beer as compliment which in our case they didnt That really killed the mood The rating is only for ambiance Later we order some cocktails as basic drinks Those were good I would suggest not to go here for buffet It is a great place for beer lovers provided they dont drink their complimentary beer   I went to brew and barbeque on Friday night  Ambiance was awesome dim lighting and nice music  We order  beer among which my favourite was brown ale  The french fries was served with the spicy cheese sauce  Nachos was full of cheese  jalopinoe poppers was awesome and were crisp from outside and soft from inside  smokey cottage cheese was full of north Indian flavours for main course we ordered pizza it was a Italian typed thin crust pizza and in the end we ordered Shai thukda which was sweet and soft like heaven  A good place to go Nice ambience but it could become very noisy when crowded The food is okay for the kind of

serve a complimentary drink which we opted to take their sample beer Honestly I think if they want to show off their brewery standard they should serve a decent variety of beer as compliment which in our case they didnt That really killed the mood The rating is only for ambiance Later we order some cocktails as basic drinks Those were good I would suggest not to go here for buffet It is a great place for beer lovers provided they dont drink their complimentary beer   I went to brew and barbeque on Friday night  Ambiance was awesome dim lighting and nice music  We order  beer among which my favourite was brown ale  The french fries was served with the spicy cheese sauce  Nachos was full of cheese  jalopinoe poppers was awesome and were crisp from outside and soft from inside  smokey cottage cheese was full of north Indian flavours for main course we ordered pizza it was a Italian typed thin crust pizza and in the end we ordered Shai thukda which was sweet and soft like heaven  A good place to go Nice ambience but it could become very noisy when crowded The food is okay for the kind of place My main focus was to try their beer but honestly I was not impressed Im comparing it to what I find in Windmills And that was the only bummer because I had high expectations after I saw a  rating  Its a very cozy place for friends to have chilled beer and some good snacks with sports screening on with a great ambience and zomato gold applicable on drinksits not heavy on your pocket as wellBeing a peaceful place with no over crowding on Friday night and with amazing and quick service they offer I tried their Cheese and jalapeno croquettes that were quite goodbut I was slightly disappointed with paneer Tikka they offered as it was bit burnt so we need to replace it and very courteously they replaced itChakori Murgh Tikka is worth trying for as my friends saidIn mocktails we tried BB exotica which was much sweeter than expected and we tried mojito as well which lived

taste was good but it is slightly pricey Value for money score would be  Service was good  Good beer and ambiance Food was fine but quantity could be more I liked their fish steak and sauce but of course you guys should consider increasing steak portion  We went there on a Saturday night while pub hopping The space is huge but there is no dance floor Despite that the music is good Was disappointed as they could not serve LIIT without even telling us the reason The beers were also finished before time Had to settle for Manhattan and Irish Car Bomb Both were well prepared though We ordered Bacon Wrapped prawns fish fingers and BB special Lamb Chops Both were absolutely delicious The ambiance is good but the only thing I missed was a dance floor Giving it a  on the basis of the tasty food and cocktailsnnA word of advice to the management is stock more of the good liquors at least on Weekends You wont regret  I heard so much stories about this place by seeing Zomato ratings
